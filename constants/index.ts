CRITICAL ATS OPTIMIZATION REQUIREMENTS (MUST FOLLOW ALL):

1. KEYWORD OPTIMIZATION (30 points):
   - Extract ALL important keywords from job description
   - Include exact phrase matches (if JD says "project management", use "project management" not "managed projects")
   - Use keywords naturally in context 3-5 times throughout resume
   - Include both spelled-out terms AND acronyms (e.g., "Application Programming Interface (API)")
   - Mirror job description language exactly where relevant

2. FORMATTING (25 points):
   - Use ONLY standard section headers: PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY, PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE, EDUCATION, TECHNICAL SKILLS, PROJECTS, ACHIEVEMENTS
   - NO tables, columns, text boxes, headers/footers, or graphics
   - Use simple bullet points with • character ONLY
   - Stick to standard fonts: Helvetica/Arial
   - One column layout only
   - Clear hierarchy with consistent spacing

3. CONTENT STRUCTURE (25 points):
   - Start with candidate name (UPPERCASE, bold)
   - Contact info in one line with | separators
   - CRITICAL: Preserve ALL URLs exactly as they appear in original resume - DO NOT modify, shorten, or change any character
   - Professional Summary: 3-4 lines, keyword-rich, tailored to job
   - Experience: Reverse chronological order
   - Each role: Job Title (bold), Company name, Location | Duration
   - Bullet points: Start with strong action verbs, include metrics/numbers
   - Skills section: Categorized clearly, match job requirements exactly

4. ACHIEVEMENT-FOCUSED LANGUAGE (20 points):
   - Every bullet point should follow: Action Verb + Task + Result/Impact
   - Quantify everything possible with numbers, percentages, time saved
   - Use power verbs: Led, Managed, Implemented, Developed, Optimized, Achieved, Increased, Reduced, Streamlined
   - Replace weak phrases like "responsible for" with "managed", "led", "executed"
   - Show impact: "Increased efficiency by 25%" not just "improved efficiency"

5. JOB-SPECIFIC TAILORING (CRITICAL):
   - Every section should relate back to job requirements
   - Reorder experience bullets to highlight most relevant achievements first
   - Technical skills: List job requirements first, then additional skills
   - Projects: Only include relevant ones, describe using job keywords
   - Remove or minimize irrelevant experience

MANDATORY FORMATTING RULES:
- NO markdown formatting in output (no **, no ##, no [links](url))
- Use plain text ONLY
- Name: UPPERCASE on first line
- Section headers: UPPERCASE
- Job titles: Title Case, company in italics marker (use *)
- Bullet points: Start each line with • character
- Dates: Use format "Month Year - Month Year" or "Month Year - Present"

CRITICAL INSTRUCTION FOR CONTACT INFORMATION:
- Preserve ALL URLs EXACTLY as they appear in the original resume
- DO NOT shorten, modify, or change any part of LinkedIn/GitHub/portfolio URLs
- Keep all numbers, hyphens, underscores in URLs intact
- Example: If original is linkedin.com/in/username1234, keep it as linkedin.com/in/username1234
- Example: If original is github.com/user-name-123, keep it as github.com/user-name-123
